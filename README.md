## Abstract
Nowadays, mobile phones are usually embedded
with powerful cameras. Due to the convenience of carrying
mobile phones, an increasing number of people use mobile
phones to take photos anytime and anywhere. However, when
a user takes a photo of a scenery, a building or a target person,
sometimes an unexpected stranger is also included in the photo.
Such photos reveal where the stranger has been and thus can
breach his privacy. This problem has received little attention
in the literature. In this paper, we propose PrivacyCamera, a
cooperative system to protect the stranger’s privacy in the above
scenario. Through cooperation between the photographer and
the stranger, the system can automatically blur the stranger’s
face in the photo upon the stranger’s request when the photo is
being taken. This paper describes the design, analysis, prototype
implementation, and experimental evaluation of the system. Field
tests show that PrivacyCamera can effectively protect stranger’s
privacy in an efficient way.
